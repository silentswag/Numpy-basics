# Numpy-basics
Basic opeartions using arrays and matrices

NumPy (Numerical Python) is a fundamental and widely used library in Python for numerical and mathematical operations. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, as well as a vast collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays efficiently. NumPy is the foundation for many other Python libraries used in scientific computing, data analysis, and machine learning.

Key features and functionalities of NumPy include:

Multi-dimensional Arrays: NumPy's primary data structure is the ndarray (n-dimensional array). These arrays can be 1-dimensional, 2-dimensional, or even higher-dimensional. They provide fast and efficient operations on large amounts of data.

Universal Functions (ufuncs): NumPy includes a wide range of universal functions that operate element-wise on arrays. These functions are designed to work efficiently with arrays of any size and shape.

Broadcasting: NumPy allows broadcasting, which is a powerful feature that enables element-wise operations on arrays of different shapes. This simplifies writing code and avoids the need for explicit loops.

Mathematical Functions: NumPy offers a comprehensive set of mathematical functions, such as trigonometric, logarithmic, exponential, statistical, etc.

Array Indexing and Slicing: NumPy provides flexible indexing and slicing capabilities to access and manipulate parts of arrays.

Array Shape Manipulation: NumPy allows reshaping, resizing, and concatenating arrays, making it easy to manipulate their dimensions.

Random Number Generation: NumPy has functions for generating random numbers with various distributions, useful for simulations and statistical analysis.

Linear Algebra Operations: NumPy provides a rich set of linear algebra functions, including matrix multiplication, eigenvalue calculations, matrix inversion, and more.

Integration with C/C++ and Fortran: NumPy arrays can be seamlessly integrated with code written in C, C++, and Fortran, allowing users to combine the performance of compiled code with the flexibility of Python.
